### What is Torsional Oscillation?
A body suspended by a thread or wire which twists first in one direction and then in the reverse direction, in the horizontal plane is called a torsional pendulum.The first torsion pendulum was developed by Robert Leslie in 1793.

 

The period of oscillation of torsion pendulum is given as,

$$T=2\pi \sqrt{\frac{I}{C}}................(1)$$

Where   I=moment of inertia of the suspended body; C=couple/unit twist 

 

But we have an expression for  couple per unit twist C as,

$$C=\frac{1}{2}\frac{\pi nr^4}{l}..............(2)$$

Where   l =length of the suspension wire; r=radius of the wire; n=rigidity modulus of  the suspension wire

Substituting (2) in (1) and squaring,we get an expression for rigidity modulus for the suspension wire as,

$$n=\frac{8\pi lI}{r^4 T^2}....................(A)$$

<p>
  We can use the above formula directly if we calculate the moment of inertia of the disc, <em>I</em>, as 
  <strong>(1/2)MR<sup>2</sup></strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Now, let <em>I<sub>0</sub></em> be the moment of inertia of the disc alone, and 
  <em>I<sub>1</sub></em> & <em>I<sub>2</sub></em> be the moments of inertia of the disc with identical masses 
  at distances <em>d<sub>1</sub></em> & <em>d<sub>2</sub></em> respectively. If <em>I<sub>1</sub></em> is the moment of 
  inertia of each identical mass about the vertical axis passing through its centre of gravity, then
</p>


$$I_1=I_0+2\,I^1+2md_1^2................\text{(3)}$$
$$I_2=I_0+2\,I^1+2md_2^2.................\text{(4)}$$
$$I_2-I_1=2m(d_2^2-d_1^2)................\text{(5)}$$

But from equation (1) ,

$$T_0^2=4\pi^2\frac{I_0}{C}............\text{(6)}$$
$$T_1^2=4\pi^2\frac{I_1}{C}............\text{(7)}$$
$$T_2^2=4\pi^2\frac{I_2}{C}.............\text{(8)}$$
$$T_2^2-T_1^2=\frac{4\pi^2}{C}(I_2-I_1).........\text{(9)}$$


<p>
  Where <em>T<sub>0</sub></em>, <em>T<sub>1</sub></em>, and <em>T<sub>2</sub></em> are the periods of torsional oscillation 
  without identical masses, with identical masses at positions <em>d<sub>1</sub></em> and <em>d<sub>2</sub></em> respectively.
</p>

<p>
  Dividing equation (6) by (9) and using equation (5),
</p>

$$\frac{T_0^2}{(T_2^2-T_1^2)}=\frac{I_0}{[I_2-I_1]}=\frac{I_0}{2m(d_2^2-d_1^2)}\qquad\text{(10)}$$

Therefore,The moment of inertia of the disc,


$$I_0=2m(d_2^2-d_1^2)\left(\frac{T_0^2}{T_2^2-T_1^2}\right)\qquad\text{(11)}$$

Now substituting equation (2) and (5) in (9),we get the expression for rigidity modulus 'n' as,

$$n=\frac{16\pi m(d_2^2-d_1^2)}{r^4}\left(\frac{l}{T_2^2-T_1^2}\right)\qquad\text{(12)}$$
