      "question": "What physical quantity is primarily measured in the torsional oscillation experiment?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Frequency",
        "b": "Moment of Inertia",
        "c": "Angular Displacement",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Frequency is related but not the primary focus.",
        "b": "Correct. Moment of Inertia is the key result measured in the simulation.",
        "c": "Angular displacement is involved but not the main outcome.",
        "d": "Mass is an input, not the measured output."

      "question": "Which parameter can be varied to study the damping effect of different liquids?",

        "a": "String type",

        "c": "Medium",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "String affects restoring torque, not damping.",
        "b": "Object shape affects inertia, not damping medium.",
        "c": "Correct. Medium affects the damping of oscillations.",
        "d": "Amplitude affects motion but not the damping medium."

      "question": "How does increasing the mass of the object affect the moment of inertia in this experiment?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It decreases the moment of inertia",
        "b": "It increases the moment of inertia",
        "c": "It does not change the moment of inertia",
        "d": "It only affects the amplitude"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Moment of inertia is directly proportional to mass.",
        "b": "Correct. More mass results in a higher moment of inertia.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Mass is a key factor in calculating moment of inertia.",
        "d": "Mass also affects inertia, not just amplitude."
