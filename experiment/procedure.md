## Procedure



<h3>Torsional Oscillations in Different Liquids (Simulation)</h3>

<p>
  Follow the steps below to perform the simulation-based experiment on torsional oscillations in different liquid media:
</p>

<h4>Controls and Settings:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Choose String:</strong> Select the type of string used in the torsion pendulum setup.</li>
  <li><strong>Choose Medium:</strong> Select the medium (e.g., air, water, oil, etc.) in which the torsion pendulum will oscillate.</li>
  <li><strong>Amplitude Slider:</strong> Adjust this slider to change the amplitude of the torsional oscillation.</li>
  <li><strong>Choose Object:</strong> Select one of the three available objects (Cylinder, Disc, Dumbbell) to analyze their effect on torsional motion.</li>
  <li><strong>Mass Slider:</strong> Use this slider to vary the mass of the selected object.</li>
  <li><strong>Length Slider:</strong> Use this slider to modify the length of the object.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Measurement:</h4>
<p>
  The simulation displays the calculated result of the experiment in the <strong>Measurements</strong> section. This includes the computed <em>Moment of Inertia</em> based on the chosen parameters and observed torsional oscillations.
</p>

<p>
  Ensure you vary one parameter at a time while keeping others constant to study its specific effect on the torsional behavior of the system.
