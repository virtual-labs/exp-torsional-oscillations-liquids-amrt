      "question": "Which of the following objects will generally have the highest moment of inertia in torsional oscillation?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Disc",
        "b": "Cylinder",
        "c": "Dumbbell",
        "d": "All have the same"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Discs have more evenly distributed mass.",
        "b": "Cylinders have moderate moment of inertia.",
        "c": "Correct. Dumbbells typically have higher moment of inertia due to mass concentration at the ends.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Moment of inertia depends on mass distribution."

      "question": "Which control in the simulation allows the user to change the object used in the torsional pendulum?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Choose Medium",
        "b": "Mass Slider",
        "c": "Choose Object",
        "d": "Choose String"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This changes the surrounding medium, not the object.",
        "b": "This modifies the object's mass, not the type.",
        "c": "Correct. This allows selection between Disc, Cylinder, and Dumbbell.",
        "d": "This changes the string, not the object."

    {
      "question": "Why is it important to vary only one parameter at a time in the simulation?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To save time",
        "b": "To isolate the effect of that parameter",
        "c": "To prevent the system from crashing",
        "d": "To increase oscillation speed"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Not the main reason.",
        "b": "Correct. It ensures a clear understanding of the influence of each parameter.",
        "c": "The system is designed to handle changes.",
        "d": "Parameter variation is for analysis, not speed control."
